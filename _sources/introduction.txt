What is FloPy? 
============================

FloPy is a collection of Python scripts for building, running, and processing MODFLOW, MODPATH, MT3D, SWI, and SEAWAT models.

The design of the FloPy project is still under development, although we are zooming in on the final structure. When the structure is complete and documented we will start asking for additional help in implementing all packages. For now, you can give it a try if you wish. It works well already for many problems.

FloPy Installation? 
============================

There is a Windows binary installer listed on the downloads page; however, this installer has not been kept up-to-date.  The best way to obtain a copy of FloPy is to retrieve a copy using Subversion, often called 'svn'.  For Windows users, `TortoiseSVN <http://tortoisesvn.net/>`__ is a very easy way to work with svn repositories and it integrates nicely with the Windows file manager.

As you will see from the FloPy `source <http://code.google.com/p/flopy/source/checkout>`__ page, the entire FloPy package can be downloaded using the following svn command.  There is also a browse tab on this page that allows you to explore the underlying FloPy source code.

svn checkout http://flopy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ flopy-read-only

As FloPy evolves, you can download updates by performing an "svn update".  This will download any new files or changes into your FloPy folder.

In the near future, we hope to offer binary installers for FloPy.
